  Sij Big doesn't exist, but I can picture it. Judging from the map, this
  coastal nation boasts a dense, old-growth rainforest and a lush island where
  fishermen dive for abalone. The weather is cool and damp, but the whale
  watching is spectacular. The Twitterbot @unchartedatlas prompted this
  daydream.
