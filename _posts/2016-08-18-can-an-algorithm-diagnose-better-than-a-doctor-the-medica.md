  Will artificial intelligence solve doctor shortages? Will it be able to
  replace the art of making a correct diagnosis? Not anytime soon. Many times
  after my talks, people ask me whether algorithms could theoretically be better
  at making a diagnosis than doctors. With my doctor's cap on, I must defend the
  art of medicine.
