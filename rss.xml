            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Untold Story of Magic Leap, the World's Most Secretive Startup</h1><p>T There is something special happening in a generic office park in an uninspiring suburb near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Inside, amid the low gray cubicles, clustered desks, and empty swivel chairs, an impossible 8-inch robot drone from an alien planet hovers chest-high in front of a row of potted plants.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c074a0d302be59dce473c720dd3426bf33ec9c32.jpg"></article>]]></description>
