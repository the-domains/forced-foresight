            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can An Algorithm Diagnose Better Than A Doctor? - The Medical Futurist</h1><p>Will artificial intelligence solve doctor shortages? Will it be able to replace the art of making a correct diagnosis? Not anytime soon. Many times after my talks, people ask me whether algorithms could theoretically be better at making a diagnosis than doctors. With my doctor's cap on, I must defend the art of medicine.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e203fef8dfe195f59f0cfbe7b32cdd9d/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fmedicalfuturist.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F05%2Fa-machine-is-about-to-do-to-cancer-treatment-what-deep-blue-did-to-garry-kasparov-in-chess.jpg"></article>]]></description>
